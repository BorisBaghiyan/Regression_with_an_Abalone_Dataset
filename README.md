# 🐚 Regression with the Abalone Dataset

This project focuses on solving a regression problem using the well-known **Abalone dataset**. The goal is to predict the age of abalone (a type of sea snail) based on physical measurements.

## 📊 Problem Overview

The age of an abalone can be estimated by counting the number of rings in its shell. However, direct measurement is difficult and time-consuming. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to predict the number of rings using features such as length, diameter, weight, and sex.
